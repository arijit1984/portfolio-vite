# Case Study D — Cloud Modernization & Migration (Multiple Banking Apps)

**Role:** Technical Architect (Lead)  
**Timeline:** 2021 – 2024  
**Technologies:** AWS (ECS, S3, RDS), Terraform, Kubernetes, Helm, Jenkins, GitHub Actions

## Challenge
A portfolio of monolithic and legacy applications required modernization to meet scale, compliance, and cost targets.

## Solution
- Performed application discovery and created a migration roadmap prioritizing high-impact services.
- Re-architected monoliths into Spring Boot microservices and containerized workloads.
- Automated infra provisioning with Terraform and standardized deployments with CI/CD (Jenkins/GitHub Actions).
- Implemented IAM guardrails, Zero Trust patterns, and compliance automation to achieve SOC2 and PCI DSS readiness.

## Results
- Migrated 15+ applications, improving scalability by ~45% and reducing hosting costs by ~30%.
- Cut release errors by 35% with standardized templates and Kubernetes + Helm orchestration.
- Reduced audit preparation effort from weeks to days via reusable architecture and compliance templates.
